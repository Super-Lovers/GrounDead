# GrounDead - Single Player, Building and Survival Game

## Description
GrounDead is a game developed in eight weeks by my team in second year of university. I was responsible for developing the whole game while collaborating with a team of two artists and three game designes. The game world is procedurally generated every time a new game is started and the player has to survive waves of zombies by applying micro or macro skills such as building or fighting. In the end, you get a high score that you can compare with your friends and other people with detailed information about your experience in the game.

### World
The game world has procedurally generated forests, rivers and minerals that give the player the tools he needs to build a base to protect himself from zombies.

### Goal
The goal of the game is to survive for as long as possible and play as best as possible to finish with a new high score.
